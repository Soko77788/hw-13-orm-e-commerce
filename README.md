  ## Installation

  To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

  * npm i
  * connect to the postgres server by running psql -U (username here) and the password for your postgres login. 
  * run the schema and seed the data running \i db/schema.sql and in the terminal npm run seed which creates the tables with starter data. 
  * In Insomnia or another route testing application test the routes to manipulate the starter data. 
  
  ## Usage
  * A Mac or PC with a terminal. Common examples are Zsh for Mac and Bash for Windows.
  * Once you navigate to the correct integrated terminal run the command node index.js to start the prompts.

  ## Tools and 3rd party assistance
  * Influenced with the week 13 ORM mini-project code. 
  * Screencastify
  * Student AI tool and ChatGPT for creating routes and learning more about creating relationships between models. 

  ## Obstacles and Successes
  * The starter code helps alot but figuring out how to create the routes and relationships is still tricky. 
  * Running insomnia is buggy for me. Sometimes it doesn't send back data when i feel like it should. 
  * Remembering how to format the Json data in insomnia. 
  * Creating associations
  * The starter code created the routers which was nice. Just having to build the route is much better as routers are still confusing. 
  * I couldn't get the product routes working correctly for updating/deleting

  * Getting the hang of screencastify using it for the 4th time. 
  * Once one set of routes was created mimicking that and using similar code for the other routes was nice. 
  * Screencastify was already installed so getting the recording down reading the docs was great.
